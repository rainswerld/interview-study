# Coding Interview Study

The coding interview deserves it's own three-month course, but alas there is
not enough time (or money, probably). Instead, we can make "studying" for
interviews part of our daily coding routine! Let's read a little about how to
prepare for interviews and what to expect once you're in one.

## Before the Coding Interview

Read through the [Study and Practice](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/study-and-practice) section of the Tech Interview Handbook and look through this [list of practice problems](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/best-practice-questions).

Below:

1. Name an interview topic you want to prioritize for your studies
2. Locate a problem from the given list (or elsewhere if you can't find one) above that will help you practice that topic
3. Explain why that problem will help you practice the chosen topic

## During the Coding Interview

Read the [During the Coding Interview](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/during-coding-interview) section and take a look through this
[cheatsheet of interview dos and don'ts](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/cheatsheet).

> **Scenario:** You're at a coding interview for your dream job. Your
> interviewer tasks you with writing a function that returns the reverse of a
> given string.
>
> Based on this scenario, answer the following questions.

1. What questions would you ask your interviewer? List at least two below.

```

```

2. Write out a high-level (using words) example of how you might solve the
given problem.

```
your answer here
```

3. Based on the high-level solution you wrote, what is the time-space
complexity? Use BigO notation to write your answer below:

```
your answer here
```

4. Given then input "cat", run through your solution. Write out in steps below
how your high-level solution would work with the "cat" input. Identify any
areas of the solution that could be improved, especially if the end result is
not "tac" (the reverse of "cat").

> **Note:** Don't worry if you don't end up with "tac" after running through
> your solution - that's often the case with our first algorithms and all the
> more reason to test it with some pretend input! The point here is not to go
> back and fix your alorithm now. Instead, we want to practice applying input
> to a high-level solution so you can modify it before you code.

5. Optional Challenge: Give the code a shot! Put your high-level solution to the test by actually coding it out below.
